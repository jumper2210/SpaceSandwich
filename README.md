### Description
This is my first bigger application written using React. The main goal was to gain practical knowledge in writing weeb applications. This is an e-commerce project using Spring-Boot technology and as connecting data for client-server relations I used REST Api approach.  It's main functionalities are:
- Creating a cosmically good sandwich, created using self-made ingredients in css .
- Ability to log in as an administrator who is able to accept the order and remove registered users from the database.
- & others...

### Main Technologies 
- React (Redux, redux-thunk, Hooks).
- API's (REST-api).
- Css (flex-box).
- & others...
